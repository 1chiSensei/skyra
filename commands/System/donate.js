    Skyra Project started on 24th October 2016, if you are reading this, you are
    using the version 1.10.0 (ThunderLight Update), which is the tenth rewrite. I have
    improved a lot every single function from Skyra, and now, she is extremely fast.

    However, not everything is free, I need your help to keep Skyra alive in a VPS so
    you can enjoy her functions longer. I will be very thankful if you help me, really,
    I have been working on a lot of things, but she is my beautiful baby, take care of her ‚ù§
