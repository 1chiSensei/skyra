# About

Welcome to **Skyra's Lounge**!

**A bit of story:** Skyra, formerly known as kyraBOT (renamed on mid-March of 2017), is a standalone Discord Bot that was born from curiosity in a SoloLearn guild, helped with other developers, I was a newbie at that moment, I made websites and templates for After Effects, but never a backend application. Skyra's name comes from a joke a user made with SkyNET, joining "kyra" with "SkyNET", ending up in "SkyraNET", I liked the name and later, she got renamed to "Skyra". Originally, it was going to be renamed as "Shiny", name taken for the currency.

Skyra does not only feature almost every single feature that is needed in the majority of guilds while it's also completely configurable, but she also has a backstory that she inherited from the lore I have been creating since I was a child.

There are over 10 rewrites (at the date of writting this, 12), with an active development of over a year, I have met many developers and friends in Discord, in February 2017, I met the Dirigeants team which I started to contribute for Komada, and later, for Klasa. Nowadays, Klasa holds the opensource part of Skyra.
